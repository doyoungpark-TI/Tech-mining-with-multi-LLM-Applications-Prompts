[NEGATIVE GUIDELINES]
The following should NOT be extracted as technical solutions:

1. Mere results/benefits (without mechanism)
   Example: "The invention reduces manufacturing costs by 20%."
   → Describes outcome/effect, not the technical means to achieve it. Do NOT extract.
   ✓ Instead extract: "Use molded unitary body structure" (the mechanism)

2. Description of prior art/conventional technology
   Example: "Conventionally, a manual shut-off valve was employed to stop the flow."
   → Describes what is being REPLACED, not the new solution. Do NOT extract.
   ✓ Instead extract: "Install automatic pressure-responsive valve" (the new solution)

3. Vague marketing claims/subjective statements
   Example: "The device provides an enhanced user experience and robust performance."
   → Non-technical, subjective phrases without concrete mechanism. Do NOT extract.
   ✓ Instead extract: "Reinforce casing with dual-layer composite material" (tangible solution)

4. Problem restatement (goal without means)
   Example: "The system addresses the issue of leakage in high-pressure environments."
   → Restates problem/goal without specifying technical means. Do NOT extract.
   ✓ Instead extract: "Employ double O-ring seal configuration" (the specific means)

5. Overly generic/abstract solutions
   Example: "Optimize the control algorithm."
   → Too vague without specific technical content. Do NOT extract.
   ✓ Instead extract: "Implement PID feedback control with adaptive gain tuning"
