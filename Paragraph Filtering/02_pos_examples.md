Example 1:
Input: "[2] However, conventional LCDs have a limited viewing angle and slow response time compared to OLEDs."
Analysis: Contains explicit limitation keywords ("limited", "slow") describing prior art drawbacks.
Output: PROBLEM

Example 2:
Input: "[4] Liquid electrolytes require non-conductive separators. However, these separators are relatively expensive and are the source of defects."
Analysis: Identifies specific disadvantages ("expensive", "source of defects") of existing components.
Output: PROBLEM

Example 3:
Input: "[2] Conventional welding processes generate excessive heat, causing thermal distortion in thin metal sheets. This requires secondary finishing steps, increasing production time and costs."
Analysis: Describes cascading problems ("thermal distortion" → "secondary steps" → "increased costs") of prior art.
Output: PROBLEM
