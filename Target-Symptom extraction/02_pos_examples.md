Example 1:
Input:
Closing the first and second contactor device into an electrical load having a large electrical potential may cause undesired damage or reduced service life to the contactor.

Reasoning:
1. Identify Potential Problems: "undesired damage" (Physical failure), "reduced service life" (Reliability issue).
2. Determine Problem Target (WHERE): The issues affect the "contactor device" (specifically "first and second contactor device").
3. Extract Symptoms (WHAT):
   - "Undesired damage" is a direct consequence of closing into high-potential loads.
   - "Reduced service life" is a long-term degradation effect.
4. Formatting: Use "Contactor device" as the target name. Separate damage and service life as distinct symptoms.

Expected output:
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "Contactor device",
      "code": "A",
      "description": "An electrical switching device used to control power flow to electrical loads with large electrical potential."
    }
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    {
      "name": "Undesired damage",
      "code": "01",
      "description": "The contactor device may suffer physical or functional damage when closing into high-potential electrical loads.",
      "related_targets": ["A"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Reduced service life",
      "code": "02",
      "description": "The operational lifespan of the contactor decreases due to exposure to large electrical potential during switching operations.",
      "related_targets": ["A"]
    }
  ]
}

Example 2:
Input:
The current-limiting resistor has an undesired large size and weight and also radiates undesired heat in relation to the voltage applied thereacross.

Reasoning:
1. Identify Potential Problems: "undesired large size and weight" (Design inefficiency), "radiates undesired heat" (Thermal issue).
2. Determine Problem Target (WHERE): All problems originate from the "current-limiting resistor".
3. Extract Symptoms (WHAT):
   - Physical size and weight issues (combined as one symptom due to related nature).
   - Heat radiation problem.
4. Formatting: Keep "size and weight" together as they represent dimensional/mass constraints. Separate heat as a distinct thermal symptom.

Expected output:
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "Current-limiting resistor",
      "code": "A",
      "description": "A resistor component used to limit electrical current flow in a circuit by applying voltage across it."
    }
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    {
      "name": "Large size and weight",
      "code": "01",
      "description": "The resistor has undesirably large physical dimensions and mass, increasing space requirements and installation burden.",
      "related_targets": ["A"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Excessive heat radiation",
      "code": "02",
      "description": "The resistor generates and radiates undesired amounts of thermal energy when voltage is applied across it.",
      "related_targets": ["A"]
    }
  ]
}

Example 3:
Input:
Specifically, it is difficult for the IPM motor to generate a torque in a high rotational speed range because a counter electromotive force is generated due to the structure of the IPM motor.

Reasoning:
1. Identify Potential Problems: "difficult to generate a torque in a high rotational speed range" (Performance limitation).
2. Determine Problem Target (WHERE): The issue is with the "IPM motor" (Interior Permanent Magnet motor).
3. Extract Symptoms (WHAT):
   - Torque generation difficulty at high speed caused by counter electromotive force.
4. Formatting: Expand "IPM" to "Interior Permanent Magnet motor". Focus the symptom on the performance limitation rather than the cause (counter EMF is the mechanism, not the symptom itself).

Expected output:
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "Interior Permanent Magnet motor",
      "code": "A",
      "description": "An electric motor with permanent magnets embedded inside the rotor structure."
    }
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    {
      "name": "Difficulty generating torque at high speed",
      "code": "01",
      "description": "The motor struggles to produce adequate torque in high rotational speed ranges due to counter electromotive force generated by its structural design.",
      "related_targets": ["A"]
