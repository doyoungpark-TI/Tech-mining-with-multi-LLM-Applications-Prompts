[DEFINITION: Explicit Causality]
Explicit causality refers to causal relationships that are directly indicated through clear linguistic markers, including: (1) causal connectives (e.g., because, due to, since, so, therefore, as a result), (2) causative verbs (e.g., cause, lead to, result in, induce, trigger, prevent, destroy), (3) resultative constructions, and (4) conditional structures (if...then). These relationships are readily identifiable through surface-level textual patterns without requiring additional inference or domain knowledge.

[DEFINITION: Implicit Causality]
Implicit causality refers to causal relationships that require inference through contextual information and background knowledge, without explicit causal connectives. These relationships are identified through: (1) temporal or procedural sequences, (2) physical/mechanical mechanisms (e.g., pressure increase causing material stress), (3) functional dependencies (e.g., component failure leading to system malfunction), and (4) ambiguous connectives (e.g., as, after) where causality must be inferred from context. This includes both intra-sentential cases (cause and effect within a single sentence) and inter-sentential cases (cause and effect across different sentences, requiring cross-sentence reasoning and discourse coherence understanding).
